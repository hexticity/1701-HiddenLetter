  <h1>ðŸ”“ You Asked Us to Look Deeperâ€”So Here I Am</h1>

  <p>Dear 1701,</p>

  <p>You asked applicants to decode a DNS record to find your email. That alone told me everything I needed to know: you're not looking for someone who does the bare minimum. You're looking for someone who gives a damn. Someone who's willing to look deeper.</p>

  <p><strong>So here I am.</strong></p>

  <p>I donâ€™t come from a traditional tech background. I didnâ€™t have a fancy home network lab growing up. What I had was curiosity, a secondhand PC, and a relentless need to understand how things worked. I learned how to fix broken drivers before I learned how to drive. I built LAN parties before I ever built a resume. I wasnâ€™t taught techâ€”I wrestled with it, broke it, rebuilt it, and made it my own.</p>

  <p>Now Iâ€™m 32. I work full-time overnight shifts at Amazon to provide for my kids. Iâ€™m a full-time student studying cybersecurity. Iâ€™ve raised a daughter from diapers and a stepson through discipline and love. Iâ€™ve changed diapers, run cables, swapped GPUs, and supported users at every level of need. And I still show up to class after a 12-hour shift because I know the life I want isnâ€™t going to hand itself to me.</p>

  <p>Hereâ€™s what Iâ€™ve learned in the process:</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Growth lives where comfort dies.</strong> I take cold showers in winter because I believe in training my mind to show up even when itâ€™s hard.</li>
    <li><strong>The smartest person in the room is often the quietest.</strong> Thatâ€™s why I listen more than I speakâ€”and I watch how the best do things before I ask for help.</li>
    <li><strong>You donâ€™t need a title to lead.</strong> Whether on the Amazon floor or in my personal life, I find ways to support, elevate, and push others forward.</li>
    <li><strong>Real tech people donâ€™t just build systems. They build people.</strong> Thatâ€™s why Iâ€™m creating projects like <em>Tucson Table</em> (a free meal-planning app for low-income families) and dreaming up <em>ControllersAndCerts</em>, a gamified learning platform to get underserved kids into tech.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>Iâ€™ve never chased status. I chase <em>substance</em>. Iâ€™m not trying to be the smartest person on your teamâ€”Iâ€™m trying to be the most coachable. Because I know if someone hands me the right tools and a little time, Iâ€™ll build something worth talking about.</p>

  <p><strong>Most Significant Project:</strong><br>
  The project Iâ€™m most proud of is the <strong>Pwnagotchi</strong> I built and maintained over the course of 8â€“9 months. Through it, I learned about WPA handshake capture, automated reconnaissance, and the practical security flaws in poorly secured networks. I studied what triggered handshakes, how to defend against them, and explored hardening techniques that could render tools like it ineffective. This wasnâ€™t just a projectâ€”it was a playground of curiosity that turned into a field manual for modern Wi-Fi defense.</p>

  <p>So, if youâ€™re the kind of company that values hunger over ego, grit over pedigree, and someone who genuinely <strong>wants to grow</strong>, Iâ€™m ready.</p>

  <p><strong>Let me be clear:</strong> Iâ€™m not asking for a handout. Iâ€™m asking for a shot.</p>

  <p>Because Iâ€™ve done more with less than most ever have.</p>

  <p class="highlight">And Iâ€™m just getting started.</p>
