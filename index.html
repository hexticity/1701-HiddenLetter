  <h1>Still Here?</h1>
  <p>Then you're exactly the kind of team I want to work for.</p>

  <p>My name is <strong>Raymond Llamas</strong>. I'm a Tucson native, a full-time Amazon worker, a full-time cybersecurity student, a father, and someone who believes in getting uncomfortable if it means getting better.</p>

  <p>I’ve broken, rebuilt, and modded Linux systems. I’ve built grocery budgeting tools for families like mine. I’ve competed in high-level gaming tournaments. But the truth is: I’m still a student — one with relentless drive and zero ego.</p>

  <p>What I need is mentorship. What I offer is total commitment, patience, humility, and fire. If you teach me, I will not waste it.</p>

  <p>I believe in service. I believe in building things that matter. And I believe this letter — that you hunted for — proves that I’m already thinking like someone who belongs on your team.</p>

  <p class="highlight">Let’s build something great.</p>

  <p>— Raymond Llamas</p>
